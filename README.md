### Learning the Basics of Markdown

We'll start off with the *Basics of Markdown!* <br>
This tutorial will be meant to teach or show the basics of Markdown, so hopefully nothing here will be too complicated. 

As you can tell, we can easily create **bold** and *italicized* text. <br>
For bold, we need to put two asterisks on both ends of the word. <br>
Down below, you will see the input and output when applying the asterisks. 

***Example***
|    Input   |  Output  |
|------------|----------|
| `**word**` | **word** |
| `**grass**` | **grass** |

Now we can move onto italics. <br>
Instead of two asterisks, we just need one on both ends.<br>

***Example***
|    Input   |  Output  |
|------------|----------|
| `*word*` | *word* |
| `*grass*` | *grass* |

If you add three asterisks, then the text will be bold and italicized.<be>

***Example***
|    Input   |  Output  |
|------------|----------|
| `***word***` | ***word*** |
| `***grass***` | ***grass*** |

In the next section, we'll talk about creating lists and other resources like that in the next page of Lists and Tables. If you really want to, you can go straight to embeds.<br>
