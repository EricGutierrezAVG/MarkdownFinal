As stated in the previous page, I'll be showing you how to create lists using markdown 

It's kinda hard to show an input and output since markdown likes to freak out when a list is inside a list. Either that or I'm doing something wrong. 

This right here is how you create a table in all its guts and glory.
```
| Text | More Text |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| One | Two |
| Three | Four |
```
And here is what it'll look like when its not in the code bubble. 
| Text | More Text |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| One | Two |
| Three | Four |

Now lets move to making lists! It'll look like this when it's displayed on the page. 
- [x] Finish 1600 assignment
- [x] Clean bathroom
- [ ] Pick up bedroom
- [ ] Study for final exam
- [x] Get ready for work
- [ ] Make food for the week

I'll show you what the code looks like now.
```
- [x] Finish 1600 assignment
- [x] Clean bathroom
- [ ] Pick up bedroom
- [ ] Study for final exam
- [x] Get ready for work
- [ ] Make food for the week
```
It's really simple but it's fast just to copy and paste the - [ ] and dont forget the space in the middle and the x if you want to mark it.
