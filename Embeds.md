# Embeds
Like I said before, we're going to talk about embeds, namely image and links. 

In the Lists and Tables Page, you saw an image being used to demonstate the bubbles. 
Since this is hosted in Github, I have that image saved in the files of this repository. 
So any png or link works like so:
```
![Dem](dem.png)
```
This is the output: <br>

![Dem](dem.png)

For a video, it's pretty much the same thing, minus the ! at the start. <br>
```
[title](https://www.example.com)
```
Then it'll come out like this: 
<br>
[Funny Jerma Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KFzbBCZJwg&pp=ygUFamVybWE%3D) 
<br>
Im putting this here for seperation. 

But yeah, thats the end of this guide since it's just for beginners.
